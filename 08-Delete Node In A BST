/*
 * Deleting a node in a Binary Search Tree (BST) involves two primary steps:
 * 
 * 1. Search for the node:
 *    - Traverse the BST using its properties (values less than the current node go to the left,
 *      values greater go to the right) to locate the node to be deleted.
 * 
 * 2. Delete the node based on its structure:
 *    - Case 1: Leaf Node (No Children)
 *      - Simply remove the node by returning `null`.
 *
 *    - Case 2: One Child (Either Left or Right)
 *      - Replace the node with its non-null child.
 *
 *    - Case 3: Two Children
 *      - Replace the node with either:
 *          a) Inorder Predecessor (largest node in the left subtree)
 *             - This node is greater than all the remaining values in the left subtree and smaller than
 *               all the values in the right subtree.
 *             - Swap its value with the node to be deleted.
 *             - Recursively delete the inorder predecessor.
 *
 *          b) Inorder Successor (smallest node in the right subtree)
 *             - This node is smaller than all the remaining values in the right subtree and greater than
 *               all the values in the left subtree.
 *             - Swap its value with the node to be deleted.
 *             - Recursively delete the inorder successor.
 *
 * Using either approach in Case 3 ensures that the BST properties remain intact after deletion.
 *
 * -------------------------
 * Example BST:
 *
 *               50
 *             /    \
 *           30      70
 *          /  \    /  \
 *        20   40  60   80
 *       /         / \
 *     10        55  65
 *
 * In this example:
 * - If we delete the node with value 50 (which has two children), we have two choices:
 *     1. Replace it with its inorder predecessor (the largest node in the left subtree, which is 40).
 *     2. Replace it with its inorder successor (the smallest node in the right subtree, which is 55).
 *
 * Both replacements ensure that properties of the BST retains its correct ordering and structure after deletion.
